# Determine a theory

This week, we are making a james cook university open house website for our group projects. Firstly we are going to decided about workflow. Workflow is very important for Web deployment. Workflow is crucial in creating a website for several reasons: such as: efficiency, collaboration, quality assurance, consistency, client satisfaction, adaptability, time and cost management, documentation, scalability and security. The part of workflow, defining roles and responsibilities is very important. So, we are divided to our test each team member in the following
-	Zar Chi Oo (14211290)                  -  Projects Manager
-	Myat Pwint Phyu (14318723)      -  Report and Data , Media collector
-	Shwe Moe Thant (14228423)     - Coder
-	Kaung Sat Paing (14399033)      - Coder and Quality Assurance(QA) checker
  
And then we are choosing a version control of code development. They are several version control in code development. There are
-	Github
-	CI/CD
-	Agile
-	Etc…
  
We all are familiar with github. Github are many effective for code development.
1. Repository Creation:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub to host your project's codebase.
2. Branching:
   - Create branches for different features, bug fixes, or development tasks to work on isolated changes.
3. Cloning:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine to have a local copy of the code.
4. Committing:
   - Make changes to the code locally and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
5. Pushing:
   - Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub to share them with the team.

6. Pull Requests:
   - Open pull requests to propose changes from your branch to the main branch, facilitating code review.
7. Code Review:
   - Collaborate with team members by reviewing and providing feedback on code changes through comments on pull requests.
8. Merging:
   - Merge approved pull requests into the main branch to incorporate the changes into the project.
9. Issues:
   - Use GitHub Issues to track and manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
That’s why we are choosing this Github.

We are setting of our website Smart Goal .

# SMART GOAL
Specific:
•	Increase open house website acceptance rates by 5%
•	Boost open house attendance during January 8-14, 2024, by 10%.

Measurable:
•	Utilize analytics tools to track website acceptance rates and attendance figures
•	Implement user registration and tracking mechanisms for quantifiable data.

Achievable:
•	Leverage the capabilities of the chosen hosting service (SiteGround) to ensure website stability and performance.
•	Implement effective SEO strategies to enhance website visibility and attract a larger audience.
•	Utilize social media and other promotional channels to increase awareness and participation.


Relevant:
•	Ensure that the website provides valuable information for prospective students and visitors.
•	Enhance user engagement by incorporating interactive elements and showcasing the university's offerings


Time-Bound:
•	Regularly review and assess analytics data during and after the open house period to measure success against goals.
•	Conduct a thorough analysis post-event to measure the success of the website against acceptance rate and attendance goals.

# Determine a test
After doing this project, I have learn a lot of things. Such as Wordpress workflow, code development, why is important choosing a hosting and making with group work experiences.
In addition to gaining insights into WordPress workflow, code development, hosting choices, and group work experiences, determining an effective testing strategy has proven to be a pivotal aspect of this project. Testing serves as a crucial checkpoint in the development process, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the website. Through this project, I've learned the importance of systematic testing methodologies, encompassing unit testing for individual components, integration testing to evaluate the interactions between different modules, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate that the final product aligns with client requirements.

Implementing comprehensive testing has not only allowed for the early detection and resolution of bugs but has also played a significant role in maintaining code quality and preventing issues from reaching the production environment. The testing phase, when integrated seamlessly into the development workflow, contributes to the overall robustness of the website, providing a solid foundation for a positive user experience.

Moreover, this experience has highlighted the significance of creating and maintaining test cases, ensuring that they cover various scenarios and edge cases. Effective testing, combined with regular feedback loops, has proven instrumental in refining the codebase and enhancing the overall reliability of the website. Moving forward, the lessons learned in devising and implementing a robust testing strategy will undoubtedly influence my approach to future web development projects, reinforcing the notion that thorough testing is an integral part of delivering a successful and resilient website.

# Learning Insights
Through the completion of this project, I've gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development. The experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the WordPress workflow, encompassing the intricacies of content management, theme customization, and plugin integration. This hands-on exposure to WordPress has not only enhanced my technical skills but has also illuminated the importance of selecting the right tools for specific project requirements.

The process of code development during this project has been a significant learning curve. I've honed my coding skills, delving into both front-end and back-end aspects. This experience has emphasized the significance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. The iterative nature of development, marked by frequent commits and collaborative code reviews, has instilled in me the importance of version control and the Git workflow.

Choosing an appropriate hosting solution emerged as a critical decision in the success of the project. I've come to appreciate the impact of hosting on website performance, scalability, and overall user experience. Evaluating hosting options, understanding server configurations, and optimizing for speed and security have become integral components of my skill set.

Perhaps one of the most enriching aspects of this project has been the exposure to group work dynamics. Collaborating with team members such as Zar Chi Oo, Myat Pwint Phyu, Shwe Moe Thant, and Kaung Sat Paing has brought forth a diversity of skills and perspectives. This group work experience has taught me the importance of effective communication, task allocation, and mutual support in achieving project goals. It has underscored the idea that successful web development is not just about individual technical prowess but also about seamless teamwork.

In conclusion, this project has been a multifaceted learning journey. From technical intricacies like WordPress workflows and coding practices to crucial decisions like hosting selection and the dynamics of group collaboration, each facet has contributed to my growth as a web developer. This experience has not only expanded my technical toolkit but has also fostered a holistic understanding of the interconnected elements that contribute to successful web development projects.
