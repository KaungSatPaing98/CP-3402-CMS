## Content Insights:

I began by making a duplicate of the style.css file as a backup plan. Initially, I modified the webpage's background color. Then, I adjusted the text underline thickness and changed the text-decoration-style from none to dotted. Additionally, I altered the color to red for text decoration styles. Afterward, I tweaked the margin-left from -1 to -5 and margin-right from -1 to -15 for the top images. Finally, I set the font-size to 50px.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

I acquired knowledge in CSS styling through WordPress. Although similar to HTML CSS, the WordPress approach is user-friendly, and once modifications are completed, activating the theme is straightforward. This experience provided a smooth transition from prior HTML/CSS learning and emphasized the ease of implementing changes within WordPress.

By organizing these changes step-by-step and sharing the insights gained, it appears more structured and showcases your learning process effectively.
