This week, our focus is on crafting a new theme for our website. We've begun by delving into PHP coding, starting with the creation of essential components like the header, footer, functions, index, and individual pages. As we've introduced media elements into our site, the transition from HTML to PHP has presented challenges, given my prior familiarity with HTML and the nuances that differentiate PHP, albeit sharing some similarities with HTML. Despite these hurdles, the inclusion of media has added visual depth to our website. Exploring PHP's intricacies feels like uncovering a new layer of web development, offering dynamic functionalities beyond HTML's static structure. Embracing this learning curve signifies a step toward creating more interactive and engaging websites.
