I began by installing the Xampp server, which proved to be quite challenging. Initially, I downloaded the Xampp zip file and proceeded to uninstall and reinstall it. However, I encountered difficulties in running the SQL server within Xampp. I attempted various troubleshooting methods, including following YouTube tutorials, but none proved effective. Finally, I recalled that another MySQL application was running in the background on my PC, causing the conflict. Upon closing this conflicting MySQL app, the issue was resolved. Subsequently, I created a new domain for my WordPress site and completed the final step by successfully setting up the WordPress site.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Dealing with technical challenges like setting up servers requires problem-solving. Your persistence in troubleshooting the Xampp issue and identifying the conflict with another MySQL application showcases your ability to diagnose and resolve problems systematically. Despite facing difficulties, you sought solutions independently by watching tutorials on YouTube. This indicates your inclination to use available resources to solve problemsâ€”a valuable skill in any technical field.
